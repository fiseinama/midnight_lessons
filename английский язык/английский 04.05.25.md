b Long tunnels can make drivers fall asleep.

2) The tallest buildings in the world (at the time of writing) are the Petronas Towers, which dominate the skyline of Kuala Lumpur.
a The Petronas Towers are currently the tallest buildings in the world.

3) Humans have built on land, underground, on the sea, and underwater, so the next frontier for construction may be space, offering limitless expansion possibilities.
b Humans may build in space.

Ex.2

A
Numerous nations worldwide are experiencing population growth, with certain countries seeing their populations rise by up to two percent every ten years. This demographic surge leads to greater housing needs and contributes to overcrowding in urban areas.

B
A prominent feature of modern major capital cities is the significant improvement in their public transportation networks. These enhanced systems motivate residents to opt for public transit over using personal automobiles.

C
Tall buildings have become a standard feature in large metropolitan areas. These towering structures are considered an effective approach to address land scarcity, as vertical construction allows for maximizing living space within limited ground areas.

Ex.3

A: Population growth increases housing demand and leads to overcrowding in cities.
B: Improved public transport encourages people to use it instead of personal cars.
C: Tall buildings help solve land shortages by building upwards.

Ex.4



1) What was built and why?
Due to an increase in traffic between the various islands which make up Japan, and predictions of a continuing growth in train travel, a rail tunnel was built to connect the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido.

2) Significance?
The Seikan Tunnel in Japan is today the longest railway tunnel in the world

3) Length?
With a length of almost 54 km.

4) Date opened?
When the tunnel was opened in 1988, all the existing trains between Honshu and Hokkaido went through it.

5) Use?
More people travel by plane than train, and the tunnel is not used as much as forecasters had predicted.

Ex.5

The Seikan Tunnel in Japan, built to connect the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido due to growing train traffic, is the longest railway tunnel in the world, measuring nearly 54 km. It was opened in 1988 and initially used by all trains between the islands. However, because air travel became faster and cheaper, the tunnel is now used less than expected.
