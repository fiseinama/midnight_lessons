Read the article. Is the information in sentences 1–8 expressed as a fact (F) or speculation (S) in the text? How do you decide?
1.	International trade is responsible for the increase in world economic growth. (S)
o	This is speculation because the text uses the word "argued," which suggests that this is an opinion or claim rather than a confirmed fact.
2.	The world economy has increased substantially since the 1960s. (F)
o	This is a fact because the text clearly states that the global economy has grown enormously over the past 50 years without any qualifiers.
3.	Average income in China has increased in the last 20 years. (F)
o	This is a fact because the text provides specific figures showing the rise in per capita income in China from 1980 to 2000.

o	This is a fact because the text directly states that countries producing coffee import the packaging for it.

o	This is a fact because the text explains that two-way trade enables commerce to develop in both countries, presenting it as a direct benefit.

o	This is speculation because the text uses the phrase "may be forced," indicating a possibility rather than a certainty.
