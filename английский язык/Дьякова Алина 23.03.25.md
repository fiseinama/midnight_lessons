Ex.2
Fair trade encourages development of the local communities and helps to reduce environmental damage. Many fair trade producers use systems which allow the soil to recover naturally without chemicals. They also use their financial and technical expertise in their communities. For instance, a coffee co-operative in Mexico started a public bus service in the village. Another example is producers of organic rice in Thailand who use traditional techniques which do not use chemicals or exhaust the soil. These practices demonstrate how fair trade benefits both people and the environment.
