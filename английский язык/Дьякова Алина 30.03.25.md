1. Emperor Qin’s achievements
Emperor Qin was one of the most important rulers in Chinese history. He conquered six other states, became the first emperor of a united China, built the first Great Wall, and introduced a common form of writing.
2. Ancient Chinese beliefs about the afterlife
The ancient Chinese believed their ‘afterlife’ was similar to life on earth.Objects useful in the next life were buried with them. Emperor Qin ordered an army to protect his palace in the afterlife.
3. Method of ancient Chinese craftsmen
Craftsmen used a production line: body parts (legs, arms, heads) were made separately, then assembled. Figures were baked in kilns.
4. Causes of statue damage
A fire after Qin’s death (likely set by invaders) collapsed roofs, crushing statues. Most were broken or completely destroyed.
5. Preservation efforts
Workers search for fragments to repair statues (taking months per figure). Scientists use chemicals to protect peeling paint.
