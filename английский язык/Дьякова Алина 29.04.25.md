The longest road tunnel in the world
The world’s longest road tunnel, which was inaugurated in November 2000, goes from Laerdal to Aurland in Norway and is 24.5 km long. Before the tunnel was built, all traffic had to cross the high mountain passes, which were often closed in the winter because of snow. This tunnel allows the traffic to flow at all times of the year. The tunnel is famous for its state-of-the-art technology. Innovative ventilation systems have been installed to make sure that clean, fresh air is maintained throughout the length of the tunnel. In addition, it has exceptionally sophisticated safety measures. This impressive tunnel attracts thousands of tourists each year and has even been used for a wedding.
